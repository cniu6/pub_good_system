# AGENTS

This folder stores agent workflow artifacts for the workspace.

## Workflow
- Load `agent-guidelines.md` and follow the precautions.
- Load `history.md` and follow the record rules.

## Reminder Table
- If an agent sees a reminder row, it MUST execute the reminder and then delete that row.
- The system may auto-insert a reminder row when threshold conditions are met.

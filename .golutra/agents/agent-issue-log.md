# Agent Terminal Issue Log

## Description
- Record issues encountered during task execution.
- Each entry should be concise and include problem, action, and verification.
- If no issues occur in the current task, do not add a new entry.
- Do not write long-term rules here; promote reusable lessons to `agent-guidelines.md`.
- Use datetime format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (24h).

## Mandatory Action
- MUST: If this registration table reaches 50 entries, consolidate all table entries into generalized compliance notes in `agent-guidelines.md`, then delete the existing table rows.

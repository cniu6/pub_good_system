# Agent Terminal Guidelines

## Description
- Record long-term mandatory precautions distilled from resolved issue patterns.
- Keep each guideline concise, reusable, and easy to apply.
- Do not log one-off incident details here; keep incident facts in `agent-issue-log.md`.
- Keep the table empty when no new guidelines are added.
- Use datetime format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (24h).

## Mandatory Action
- MUST: If this registration table reaches 50 entries, compress the table into shorter and more general guidelines, keeping only stable and reusable rules.

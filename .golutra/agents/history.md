# History

## Description
- Record each Git change or local file change summary.
- Each entry includes reason, impact scope, and related links (put links in Notes when applicable).
- If owner is not specified, default to `<project-name>-agent-1`.
- Use datetime format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (24h).

## Mandatory Action
- MUST: When this table reaches 50 entries, compress the records into shorter and more general summaries, keeping stable and reusable change points.

## Record Template
| Date Time | Type | Summary | Reason | Impact Scope | Owner Id | Notes |
